# Product Hunt Launch Strategy

Launching on Product Hunt (PH) requires a specific mix of storytelling, visual polish, and community engagement.

## 1. Positioning: "Premium Open Source"
For Varisankya, the pitch is **"Android 15 Native + Material 3 Expressive."**
-   **Tagline:** High-tech, forward-looking (e.g., "Immersive, tactile subscription manager for Android 15").
-   **Pricing:** "Free" (No promo codes). This maximizes "Product of the Day" potential.
-   **Link:** Use the **Play Store Link** for conversion, but shout out "Open Source" to build developer trust.

## 2. Asset Checklist
-   **Thumbnail (GIF/PNG):** 240x240. Must use glassmorphism or 3D depth. No flat icons.
-   **Gallery:**
    -   **Image 1 (Social Preview):** High-end device render (Pixel 9/Pro) showing Dark Mode UI. 16:9 ratio.
    -   **Screenshots:** Real UI shots showing:
        -   M3E Column Chart (Visuals)
        -   Settings (Customization)
        -   Search (Typography)
-   **Video:** 15s-30s screen recording focusing on **motion** and **haptics** (the "Mechanical Scroll Feel").

## 3. The "Maker Comment" Structure
The first comment is crucial. It must:
1.  **State the "Why":** "I was tired of flat finance apps..."
2.  **Highlight the Tech:** "Native Edge-to-Edge," "No Toasts," "Silent UX."
3.  **Invite Feedback:** "What do you think of the tactile feel?" (Never ask for upvotes).

## 4. Shoutouts
Always shout out the tools used to appear on their product pages:
-   **Firebase** (Backend/Auth)
-   **Android Studio** (Profiling/Dev)
-   **Google Fonts** (Typography)

## 5. Scheduling
-   **Reset Time:** PH resets at **12:01 AM PST**.
-   **Strategy:** Schedule the launch for the *start* of the day to maximize visibility time.
